Guess the Color 

This is a project called as GUESS THE COLOR. 
The primary objective of this game is to guess the color whose RGB Value is displayed on the top. 
Currently, there are two modes in the game: Easy and Hard. 
In EASY mode, three colors will be displayed and we have to select right color whose value is displayed on the top. 
Similarly in the HARD mode, there will be six colors given to us and we have to make the guess. 

All the colors are choosen at random. 

For this Project, I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 
The main aim of this project was to get some practise on DOM MANIPULATION. 

Thanks.
